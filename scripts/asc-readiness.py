"""Report what the App Store Connect record still needs before submission.

Read-only. Run it before a submission pass to see the gaps rather than
discovering them in the ASC web UI one blocked field at a time.

    python3 scripts/asc-readiness.py

Note on paths: `asc_lib.API` already ends in `/v1`, so every path passed to the
client must start at the resource (`/builds`, not `/v1/builds`).

Two things this script cannot see, because Apple does not expose them in the
App Store Connect API at all:

  * the **Regulated Medical Device** declaration (App Review 1.4.1), which is
    web-UI only. Baby Tracker answers No: it tracks a number the user or
    their clinician set and makes no diagnostic or treatment claim.
  * whether the privacy/support/marketing URLs actually resolve. This script
    fetches them, because App Review rejects on a dead privacy URL and the
    fleet convention of serving them from the repo's own GitHub Pages means
    they 404 until that repo exists and is public.
